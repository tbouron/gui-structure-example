// This is the file where you can define which other less files you want to use

// For example, let's take all the bootstrap less file
@import "../vendors/bootstrap/less/bootstrap";
// But you could customize that by taking the content of the previous file, paste it here and commented out what you don't want.

// Then, you can add you custom variables. Less will override them even if the file comes after. Handy! :)
@import "_variables";
